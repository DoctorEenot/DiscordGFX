# DiscordGFX
Graphics engine for text messages(firstly designed for Discord)

DiscordGFX.py - main 2D engine

To use it, you must open chat in discord, because it sends "pixels" as text message

If you can't understand why nothing appears in discord, check that video (https://youtu.be/yt3ilDZr94A)

Actually you can send messages via bot, but that's pretty easy, so you can write that by yourself.
